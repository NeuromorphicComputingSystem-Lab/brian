Creating a new quick release of Brian
=====================================

The idea of a quick release is that it can be generated very quickly,
and users experiencing bugs can download it, but that it's not as
polished as a release with a version number. In particular, we don't
update the docs, make sure that all the tests run, etc.

Steps:

* Check files with track_files.py
* Run create_quickrelease.py or start the "Quickrelease" job on Jenkins
* Test the generated files from Jenkins or in the Brian/dist folder install and
  run correctly.
* If not, you may need to update setup.py
* Upload the files to the Trac
