BEP-3: Quality tools
Abstract: We should set up a series of quality tools (scripts) to ensure the quality of the
code, such as style, test and documentation coverage, efficiency tests (benchmarks).
This would be very useful if we want to welcome new developers.

Available tools
---------------
* pylint, pychecker, pymetrics, pyflakes
* In Eclipse: run as code coverage + code coverage results view
* In Eclipse: pylint (in Pydev preferences). I could not install it yet...

Tests
-----
[DONE] * Have an additional separate module with user-defined tests? (or more global tests)
* Handling bugs: write failing tests. When the bug is solved, the test passes and can be
added to the test suite.

Style
-----
* Style checker (e.g. from brian import * and check all globals)

Miscellaneous ideas
-------------------
[DONE] * Write a guide for developers
* Automatically find obsolete functions/classes (unused ones)
