[Windows instruction]

Personal Condor (jobs run on local machine only):
=================================================
What worked for me:
* Path: C:\condor\bin
* What seems to be important in the config file: the hostname. Give it at
installation time.
* Do not specify the administrator email
(I had a bug with condor_mail.exe never stopping! I don't know why)
* Have the latest Java JRE installed
* To debug, install Condor to accept all jobs immediately
* Choose to create a new pool

Apparently, Condor jobs are run with a special run account that doesn't have
many rights.
Follow the instructions there:
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.2/6_2Microsoft_Windows.html
Set the local config file as they say, customize "Administrator" and don't
forget to set the password.

Then all Condor submission files need to have the following line:
run_as_owner=True
(otherwise weave raises an error)

Second problem, Matplotlib cannot run:
RuntimeError: Failed to create ~/.matplotlib; consider setting MPLCONFIGDIR to a writable directory for matplotlib configuration data
Solution: add the following line to your Condor submission files:
environment = "MPLCONFIGDIR=."
or choose any other directory.
