Plasticity
==========

.. note::
    The classes below are only working with the :class:`Connection` class.
    Consider using the newer :class:`Synapses` class as a replacement, it
    allows you to flexibily express plasticity rules in a very similar way to
    the classes below. A single :class:`Synapses` object can therefore
    completely replace the combination of :class:`Connection` +
    :class:`STDP`, for example. See :doc:`synapses` for more details.
